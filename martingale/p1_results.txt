================================================================================

EXPERIMENT 1: UNLIMITED BANKROLL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 1: Probability of winning exactly $80
  Answer: 1.000000 (1000 out of 1000 episodes)

Question 2: Expected value after 1000 spins
  Answer: $80.00

Question Set 3: Standard deviation lines analysis
  Upper std dev (mean + stdev) max value: $2078.84
  Lower std dev (mean - stdev) min value: $-2072.77
  Upper line stabilized: True

ADDITIONAL STATISTICS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Experiment 1 - Standard deviation: $0.00
Experiment 2 - Standard deviation: $159.93

================================================================================
NOTE: Question 7 asks about the benefits of using expected values.
This is a conceptual question that should be answered based on
your understanding of statistics and the experimental results above.
